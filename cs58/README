FYI:

useful to look at:
  sample/  contains some useful files; you should copy them and work from there.
  	   (and don't forget sample/test/ !)

  include/ contains the header files.

useful to have acess to
  lib*/     contains libraries used when building your kernel and user code

  etc/     contains some relics of building the support library,
    	  and the code that run in your terminal windows
don't actually COPY these; your Makefile will find them


irrelevant:
  support/ contains the source code for the support libraries

illegal:
  kernel/: contains a sample kernel implementation. (FORBIDDEN!)
  

eval/ and old/ contain various relics of testing; don't go there.
